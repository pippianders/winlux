Imaging Windows 10				DT 12-02-2015
=========================

Capturing and Deploying Windows Images for the Linux Admin:

  Unfortunately, Windows doesn't give you tools to access
  low-level block devices or an easy way to copy 
  configuration from machine to machine. On top of
  all that, there's n+1 layers of proprietary databases,
  tools, formats, and what-have-you over something that
  a *nix OS makes super simple. 

  Never fear, because I am here to tell you that it
  absolutely IS possible to capture and deploy an image
  to that 1% of your environment that HAS to be Windows,
  WITHOUT needing a Windows Server environment. 

  Of course, since Microsoft is in the picture, FOSS
  goes straight out the Windows, but you can still get
  by with software that is free-as-in-beer.


Components involved in this solution:

	-Windows 10
		+Sysprep
	-Windows Assesment and Deployment Kit (ADK)
		+WinPE
		+imagex
		+Windows IMaging format (WIM)
		+Windows System Image Manager (SIM) 
		+Answer Files
	-Windows 10 Install Media
		+setup.exe


Windows Environment
---------------------------

Setting up:

  It's reccommended to set up 2 Windows machines: your template
  machine, and a tech machine. Your template machine is where you 
  set up Windows the way you want and capture the image from, and
  your tech machine holds your tools like ADK, your WinPE media, 
  and where you can work with Microsoft Supported tools.


Template Machine:

  Start with a factory fresh install of Windows 10, go through the
  setup, and start installing and configuring to your heart's content.
  When you are content with it, it's time to do Sysprep.

  Sysprep is a tool included in the base install of Windows
  that removes any hardware-specific information, and also returns
  Windows to its "Out Of Box Experience" (OOBE).

  To run Sysprep, open a run prompt (WinKey-R), and type "sysprep"
  and click OK. This will bring up an Explorer window. Open sysprep.
  For System Cleanup Action, select "Enter Out of Box Experience".
  Select Generalize, and for Shutdown Options select Shut Down.
  
  Now your template machine is "Syspreped" and ready for the image
  to be captured. Don't boot the computer up to Windows again until
  you have a WinPE disk ready. If you boot the computer up again, 
  you will need to sysprep again. 


Tech Machine:

  On your tech machine, install Windows ADK and create a WinPE disk.
  Please refer to the instructions in operator_comps/winpe/README 



Capture The Image
--------------------

Capture using imagex:

  Once booted to your WinPE media (that has imagex installed),
  get an idea of where your volumes are. Run "diskpart" in the
  cmd window. At the DISKPART prompt, run "list volume". This 
  will show the volumes availible to you. When you're done with 
  diskpart, exit. 

  Now it's time to capture your image:
	imagex /capture C:\ C:\image.wim "ImageName"

  Refer to https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc749447(v=ws.10).aspx
  for other imagex options.

Note:
  It is completely acceptable to use the source drive as the 
  destination of the WIM image. imagex is smart enough to skip
  the resulting file when archiving. Sometimes it can be the 
  best solution for capturing an image depending on the resulting
  size.
